## Blog → Solutions Page Strategy

**All pages will be built in Version 1**, but blogs will complement and support them:

### How Blogs Support Solutions Pages:

1. **Write blog posts on related topics**
   - Each solution page can reference 2-3 relevant blog posts
   - Blog posts provide deeper dives on specific angles
   
2. **Link from solutions pages to relevant blog posts**
   - Internal linking strengthens SEO
   - Provides additional resources for engaged readers
   
3. **Use blog content to test messaging and angles**
   - Test different positioning approaches
   - Validate problem statements and pain points
   - Experiment with new angles before committing to page redesigns
   
4. **Repurpose best-performing blog content into page sections**
   - Successful blog sections can be adapted for solution pages
   - High-engagement content informs page structure
   
5. **Build backlinks to blog posts, which pass authority to solutions pages**
   - External links to blog posts boost domain authority
   - Internal links from blogs pass authority to solutions pages
