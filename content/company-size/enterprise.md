## Overview (350 words)

**H2:** The Enterprise CI Challenge: Scale, Security, Integration, Customization

Enterprise competitive intelligence requirements are different from startups:

**Scale Across Hundreds of Users:**
Sales teams across geographies. Marketing teams by region and function. Product teams by product line. Leadership across business units. Hundreds of users need competitive intelligence.

**Security & Compliance:**
Enterprise security requirements: SSO, SAML, on-premise deployment, data residency, audit logs, compliance certifications.

**Integration Complexity:**
Integrate with Salesforce, SAP, Workday, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gong, Chorus, Highspot, Seismic, and 20+ other enterprise tools.

**Customization Requirements:**
Enterprise battlecard templates, custom workflows, unique competitive frameworks, specific data sources, tailored intelligence.

**Governance & Control:**
Who can access what competitive intelligence? Approval workflows? Version control? Change management?

**Internal Data Integration:**
Integrate proprietary competitive intelligence: call transcripts, sales data, internal research, win/loss data, strategic frameworks.

**Traditional CI tools either:**
- Too simple for enterprise needs (startup tools that don't scale)
- Too rigid for enterprise complexity (one-size-fits-all enterprise tools)

**CIx provides:** Enterprise scale + startup agility. Security and compliance + ease of use. Powerful customization + intuitive interface.

**Design Notes:**
