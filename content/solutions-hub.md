**Q: How is CIx different from traditional CI tools?**
A: CIx is built for real-time competitive intelligence, not quarterly updates.

Traditional CI tools require manual updates and exist as separate platforms - CIx meets your teams where they work.

**Q: Do I need a dedicated CI team to use CIx?**

**Q: Which solution is right for me?**
A: Start with your role or team. If you're in sales, explore /solutions/sales. If you're solving a specific problem (like sales enablement), explore /use-cases/sales-enablement. If your industry has unique needs (like legal or healthcare), explore industry-specific solutions. All solutions are powered by the same CIx platform.

**Q: Can I customize CIx for my company?**
A: Yes. CIx is fully customizable. You can add your own playbooks, integrate internal data sources (call transcripts, sales notes, docs), tailor battlecard templates, and configure intelligence for your brand's tone and perspective.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Most teams are up and running the same day. Add competitors, generate battlecards, and start enabling teams within hours. Enterprise implementations with custom integrations typically take 1-2 weeks.
