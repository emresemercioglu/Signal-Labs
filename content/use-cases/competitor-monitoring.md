## Overview (300 words)

Competitive landscapes change daily: pricing updates, feature launches, messaging shifts, product announcements.

Manual competitor monitoring can't keep up. Check competitor websites once per week? You miss 6 days of changes. Monthly competitive reviews? You're always 30 days behind.

**CIx monitors competitors 24/7 automatically.** Website changes, pricing updates, product launches, press releases, social media posts - tracked continuously and delivered as instant alerts.

Real-time competitive intelligence, not delayed discoveries.
