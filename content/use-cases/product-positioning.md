## Overview (300 words)

**H2:** The Positioning Challenge: Everyone Claims the Same Things

"The best solution for X."  
"The easiest way to do Y."  
"The most innovative Z platform."

**Every competitor in your space claims the same things.**

When you all sound the same, positioning stops working. Buyers can't differentiate. Your unique value gets lost in generic category messaging.

**This is the positioning crisis in crowded markets.**

The traditional positioning approach:
1. Research competitors manually
2. Identify what they claim
3. Find gaps
4. Position in those gaps

**The problem:** By the time you complete this, competitors have moved. They've taken the positioning you identified. Or worse, you both launch with similar positioning simultaneously.

**Without real-time competitive intelligence:**
- You position based on outdated competitive landscape
- You miss positioning gaps that exist today
- You can't track when competitors shift positioning
- You don't know if your positioning actually differentiates

CIx provides real-time competitive positioning intelligence for data-driven positioning decisions.

**Design Notes:**
- Positioning map visualization showing crowded claims
- White space identification
- Real-time emphasis
