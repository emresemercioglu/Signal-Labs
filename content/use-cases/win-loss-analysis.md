## Overview (300 words)

**H2:** The Win/Loss Challenge: "We Lost to Competitor" Isn't Actionable Intelligence

Your RevOps dashboard shows:
- 50 opportunities marked "Closed Lost"
- Loss reason: "Competitor"
- No other details

**What does this tell you?** That you're losing deals. **What doesn't it tell you?** Everything else:

- Which competitors are you losing to?
- In which scenarios do you lose?
- What features or pricing drove decisions?
- What patterns exist across losses?
- What should you change to improve?

**This is the win/loss intelligence gap.**

Most organizations capture that they lost to a competitor, but not the competitive intelligence that would help them win next time.

**Without competitive win/loss intelligence:**
- You can't identify which competitors to prioritize
- You don't know which enablement to improve
- You can't measure competitive win rates by segment
- You miss patterns that could inform strategy

**Meanwhile, you keep losing to the same competitors for the same reasons.**

**The solution:** Comprehensive competitive win/loss analysis with pattern detection and actionable insights.

CIx transforms win/loss from "we lost to competitor" to "we lose to Competitor X in healthcare deals over $100K due to their compliance certifications."

**That's actionable intelligence.**

**Design Notes:**
- Dashboard showing generic vs. detailed loss reasons
- Problem framing with data visualization
- RevOps/sales operations tone

## FAQ (350 words)

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is CIx different from dedicated win/loss tools like Clozd?**

A: Win/loss interview tools (Clozd, Wynter) provide deep qualitative insights from buyer interviews. CIx provides competitive intelligence and pattern detection across ALL deals. They're complementary: CIx integrates with Clozd to combine quantitative data (all deals) with qualitative insights (interview sample).

**Q: Do we need to interview buyers for win/loss analysis?**

A: Not required but recommended. CIx analyzes competitive win/loss patterns from CRM data automatically. Add interview data for deeper insights. Many teams start with CRM analysis, add interviews for critical competitors or segments.

**Q: How does CIx capture competitive loss reasons?**

A: Multiple methods: 1) Integration with CRM competitive fields, 2) Rep input via CIx interface, 3) Conversation intelligence from Gong/Chorus, 4) Win/loss interview integration. You choose methods based on your workflow.

**Q: Can we track win rates by sales rep?**

A: Yes. Track competitive performance by rep, team, region, segment, deal size, industry. Identify top performers in competitive deals and understand what makes them successful.

**Q: How long until we see actionable insights?**

A: Initial insights appear within days as CIx analyzes existing CRM data. Pattern detection becomes more robust with more data (typically actionable patterns within 30 days). Immediate value from competitor-specific win rate tracking.

**Q: What if our loss reason data is incomplete?**

A: Common challenge. CIx can help capture better data going forward: simple rep input forms, Gong/Chorus automatic capture, integration with existing processes. Start improving data quality while analyzing what you have.

**Design Notes:**
- Practical questions
- Integration with existing tools emphasized
